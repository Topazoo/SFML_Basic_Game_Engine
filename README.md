# SFML Game Development Tutorial
### Author: Peter Swanson

## Background
My first foray into game development in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library.
The tutorial this game was based on can be found at https://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition-The-Introduction.aspx

The tutorial itself appears outdated as SFML seems to be much more object-oriented than when this tutorial
was made. Thus, this project contains different data structures and design patterns than the tutorial itself.

## Configuration
This project was built for Windows using Visual Studio 2017 and statically linked SFML libraries.
Here's a handy guide for configuring Visual Studio to use SFML's libraries: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2017: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/
- SFML Visual C++ 15 (2017) - 32-bit: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/
